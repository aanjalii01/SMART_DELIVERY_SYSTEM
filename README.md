# 🚁 Smart Delivery System

An autonomous drone-based logistics solution designed to optimize package delivery in Dehradun using real-time map data and intelligent routing algorithms.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Smart Delivery System is an AI-powered logistics solution using autonomous drones to deliver packages across Dehradun. It uses real-time map data, shortest path routing with Dijkstra’s algorithm, greedy drone allocation, and altitude-based flight planning. Features include emergency delivery prioritization, real-time delivery simulation, and role-based access for users and admins.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Algorithms**:
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm for shortest path
  - Greedy approach for drone allocation
  - Sorting for altitude planning
- **Map Integration**: Real-time location input and simulation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aanjalii01/SMART_DELIVERY_SYSTEM.git
cd SMART_DELIVERY_SYSTEM
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

Now open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.
